# cxweb implementation status

## Acceptance and current gate

Target: the complete supplied PRD, not a substitute chat application. No subagents.
Current gate: **G0 IN PROGRESS**. No client or browser combination is certified.
User login and actual App/CLI picker checks remain NOT RUN. Production integration
must remain disabled until the relevant evidence exists.

## Observed environment (2026-09-17)

- Windows x64; Rust/Cargo 1.97.0.
- CLI: 0.153.4, npm installation.
- Desktop MSIX: OpenAI.Codex 26.911.7940.0.
- Running desktop backend: 0.155.0-alpha.2.6, installed runtime directory
  `OpenAI/Codex/bin/eab8377aebac6c07`. This differs from the CLI.
- The MSIX bundled executable cannot be launched directly (access denied);
  the running application uses the separately installed runtime above.
- Repository initially had no commits or origin remote; existing `.gitignore`
  excluded `/hidden-data`. Preserve that exclusion and keep supplied materials private.

## Work

- Established Rust workspace, pinned compiler, diagnostic CLI and authenticated
  loopback probe. Probe is synthetic only and rejects native inference explicitly.
- Added pure TOML preflight/removal planning, native catalog preservation tests,
  submission state machine and loopback boundary tests.
- No native config/auth files modified. No competitor source used.

## Source evidence

- Official config reference: https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-reference
  confirms user-level `openai_base_url` and startup `model_catalog_json`.
- CLI release source: `openai/codex` tag `rust-v0.153.4`, commit
  `3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a`; reviewed model-provider-info,
  models-manager and protocol/openai_models. Downloads stay in ignored `.local`.
- `openai_base_url` preserves the built-in provider identity. Its native provider
  supports WebSockets. HTTP-only success must not certify all native features.

## Verification

Executed successfully: `codex --version`, desktop backend `--version`,
`rustc --version`, `cargo --version`, `codex app-server --help`,
`git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/openai/codex.git rust-v0.153.4*`.

Passed: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
`cargo test --workspace` (8 behavioral tests), `cargo build -p cxweb`, `git diff --check`.
The first clippy run caught a collapsible conditional; corrected and reran successfully.

`node scripts/probe-client.mjs <absolute executable>` passed independently for
CLI 0.153.4 and desktop backend 0.155.0-alpha.2.6. Both returned the exact owned
model from `model/list` with `hidden: false`, accepted `thread/start`, and completed
a real provider turn through the Rust loopback server with the expected synthetic
text. Reports are in `integration-tests/compatibility/*.synthetic.json`.
This uses a static synthetic catalog and a fake API key in the isolated process;
it proves neither the real subscription catalog nor the actual UI pickers.

Desktop exact source tag: `rust-v0.155.0-alpha.2.6`, commit
`bf6f0a4ec97919bf697cdc532e7b8af4ec482fc6`. Generated both client protocol schemas
using each actual binary's `app-server generate-json-schema`. Schema output is
ignored local research; no native authentication was accessed.

## Next

Build and run the isolated client harness against both backend binaries. Record
model/list and provider request evidence separately from actual renderer/picker
evidence. Inspect desktop backend exact source/schema, then implement the native
mock upstream and private browser transport. Do not report G0 complete from an
app-server listing alone.

## Additional implementation and evidence

The G0 actual-picker gate remains open. Per quality document section 2, independent
implementation continues without claiming a live gate passed. No production UI
or real configuration mutation is enabled yet.

- Windows private browser transport implemented in the small OS-only platform
  crate, with explicit inherited-handle allowlist, suspended startup, job-object
  containment, bounded CDP frames and no debug TCP endpoint.
- `scripts/probe-browser.ps1 -Browser <Chrome executable>` passed with
  Chrome/152.0.7977.84, CDP 1.3: zero listeners, 10 owned processes, all cleaned up
  after forcibly terminating the launcher. Separate fresh profile, no login.
  Evidence: `integration-tests/compatibility/windows-chrome-pipe.local.json`.
  This uses the installed signed Chrome payload for the development spike;
  bundled browser delivery/signature/update qualification is still outstanding.
- Strict envelope parser rejects duplicate keys at all depths, trailing data,
  fences, wrong nonce/purpose, model-supplied IDs, unknown tools and bad schemas.
  Native function/custom/namespace identities are kept separate. All 15 supplied
  synthetic PRD envelope fixtures pass their expected accept/reject results.
  Only plain-text custom tools are currently supported; grammar tools are
  explicitly rejected pending a qualified grammar adapter.
- Native HTTP transport uses a fixed reviewed subscription host, TLS validation,
  disabled environment proxies and redirects, streaming backpressure and bounded
  concurrency. Mock tests prove native byte/header/status preservation. Browser
  branch receives no native transport headers. Native WebSocket and auxiliary
  endpoint qualification are still outstanding, so no production route is installed.
- Added bounded per-account scheduler (2 generations, 8 queued, 10 minute queue
  deadline), cancellation cleanup and session isolation. Added SQLite metadata
  ledger on blocking workers: request/session/input hashes only, durable state,
  replay rejection and explicit uncertainty after a crash during submission.
- Current `cargo test --workspace`: 25 tests pass (includes the 15-case fixture
  loop). `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passes.
  Initial ledger build found a MutexGuard coercion error, fixed before these passes.

Next independent work: canonical request/response wire mapping, native transport
completion, browser DOM fixture adapter and protected state/config lifecycle.
User login is not yet requested: the runnable app flow is still being assembled.

## Canonical protocol increment

- Added complete-history canonical decoding, role/tool-result preservation,
  nonportable reasoning/compaction rejection, explicit image/output-format errors,
  byte-budget refusal without truncation, and observed model/effort fidelity checks.
- Added complete buffered Responses/SSE encoding for text, native functions and
  custom calls, stable caller-owned IDs and ordered terminal events. Browser
  token counts are unavailable and are not fabricated.
- Added an original syntax-only recognizer for the exact native apply_patch Lark
  contract with SHA-256 `d6367f4826ed608c424b0a308f3d6163527df63c22513d089b91863552f8bfeb`.
  Unknown/custom grammar definitions still fail closed. This code never applies
  patches. The grammar source was inspected from the official pinned Codex release;
  no competitor source was used or copied.
- Extended the opt-in synthetic backend probe to capture ONLY tool definitions
  into ignored `.local`, never headers, prompts or conversation history. The
  desktop backend probe still passes. Its default synthetic model request includes
  `request_user_input`, `view_image`, `multi_agent_v1` namespace and server-side
  `web_search`. The canonical adapter currently rejects server-side built-ins;
  this integration gap must be resolved explicitly, not silently dropped.
- `cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` and
  `cargo test --locked --workspace` pass, now 31 tests. `cargo fmt --all` and
  `git diff --check` pass. No actual web model/tool loop is claimed yet.

Next: connect these modules into a browser/session provider with deterministic
DOM fixtures, qualify native WebSocket/catalog behavior, protect persistent
state and implement the login/control surface. Real App/CLI picker tests and
account login remain NOT RUN; user action is not requested prematurely.

## Browser operations and durable turn coordination

- Added bundled fixed DOM operations for baseline, literal composer insertion,
  one Send click, attributed observation and Stop. Prompt strings travel as CDP
  values, never as executable script. Origin is checked both via the frame tree
  and inside the fixed page function to close the navigation race.
- Added logical turn tracking: exclude historical IDs, require a matching new
  user message, reject replaced assistant identity, require explicit completion
  evidence, reject fenced output and committed-prefix revisions, and preserve
  uncertainty when cancellation happens during submission.
- Real Chrome/152.0.7977.84 over the private Windows pipe passed the bundled DOM
  fixture: literal quotes/Unicode/script-like text, old-message exclusion,
  response attribution, Stop action, and selector-drift rejection. Zero TCP
  listeners and full owned-process crash cleanup still pass. Evidence is
  `integration-tests/compatibility/windows-chrome-dom.local.json`.
  These selectors are candidates tested on synthetic markup, NOT qualified
  against the live ChatGPT UI. Login, model discovery and Temporary Chat evidence
  remain absent and cannot be inferred from this result.
- Added the runtime Coordinator joining canonical decode, scheduler, SQLite
  admission/state transitions, browser-driver operations, envelope validation,
  native wire delivery and a bounded 8 MiB replay cache. Completed responses can
  be delivered again without submitting again. Missing replay data fails explicitly.
- Coordinator work retains its own lifetime: dropping the client future triggers
  cancellation but allows browser stop/release and durable state writes to finish.
  Tests cover final response/replay, native tool output without local execution,
  uncertain submission, malformed output, mismatched assistant identity and
  dropped-client cancellation. BrowserDriver has a mock implementation in these
  tests; the real session-owning worker is the next integration step.
- Latest checks passed: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
  `cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo test --locked --workspace` (39 tests), `cargo build -p cxweb`,
  `scripts/probe-browser.ps1 -Browser <installed Chrome path>`, `git diff --check`.

Next dependency-ready implementation: real browser worker with protected profile
and account/route/session leases, then wire Coordinator into Gateway through a
qualified provider. Keep production routing disabled until authentication,
model discovery, native WebSocket preservation and actual pickers are proven.

## Development login panel and protected state

- Windows state now uses the OS LocalAppData location and protected directories
  owned by the current user, with full access only for that user and SYSTEM.
  Existing unexpected ownership, ACLs and reparse points are rejected. Tests
  exercise ACL verification and exclusive instance-lock release.
- Added a Tauri 2 development panel with two local IPC commands: connect and
  status. A bounded browser worker opens the official sign-in page in the app's
  dedicated profile over the private pipe. Remote pages cannot navigate the
  privileged control window. No Codex configuration is installed by this panel.
- Structural login observations do not certify account identity or readiness.
  The displayed state remains awaiting verification. Reopening an unavailable
  login browser requires an explicit action and preserves its dedicated profile.
  This worker is non-generative; production daemon lifetime and real session
  leases remain separate unfinished work.
- The desktop executable built and its native window opened and closed with
  exit code zero in a local smoke check. This is not visual or live login proof.
- All project-facing text is English, including UI, window titles and fixtures.
  Unicode tests use emoji instead of Czech words. User-supplied ignored source
  material remains unchanged. README remains the minimal development placeholder.
- Verification: `cargo test --locked --workspace` passed 41 Rust tests;
  `node --test apps/desktop/tests/app.test.mjs` passed 3 UI behavior tests.
  CI now includes the UI tests. Full live authentication/model discovery,
  actual Codex pickers and coding qualification are still outstanding.

## Live login attempt and disconnect planning

- Inspected the actual Tauri window through Windows Computer Use. English text
  rendered correctly, and Connect ChatGPT opened the dedicated Chrome window.
  The panel rendered Waiting for sign-in. This verifies the UI-to-worker path,
  not an authenticated session.
- The user attempted login and reported an OpenAI Route Error 400 with an HTML
  content-type mismatch after entering credentials and submitting Login. Their
  later clarification supersedes the initial report that the error occurred
  before the form. A recent fresh login by the same method worked in their normal
  browser. Root cause remains unknown; no credential/cookie export, stealth
  patch, automated login retry or routing installation was performed. G1 fails
  pending a successful supported login and actual account/model verification.
- Disconnect planning now accepts exact published route receipts. A persisted
  owned model selection restores the pre-connect native selection only when
  that selection is currently verified; otherwise the owned selection is removed.
  Native, third-party and unpublished webbridge selections are preserved.
- Regression tests exposed comment loss when deleting TOML keys. Removal now
  retains attached user comments, including when the route was already removed.
  This remains pure planning. Durable journals, atomic replacement and live
  editor race qualification are still required before real configuration writes.
